# Pneumonia-Detection

## Motivation
A pneumonia detection model can help improve patient care
by assisting doctors in making faster and more accurate
diagnosis, reducing the workload of medical professionals,
and identifying patients who may need urgent treatment. It
can also help prevent the spread of the disease.

## Our Solution
We propose a CNN model that has a relatively shallow architecture with four blocks
of layers. Each block consists of a

- Convolutional layer
- Batch Normalization
- Activation layer with the ReLU function
- Max pooling layer
- Dropout layer

## Performance Metrics
*Val accuracy: 94%*

*Test accuracy: 82%*
